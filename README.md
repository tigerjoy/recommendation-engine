# recommendation-engine

## What work's and what doesn't?

1. <strike>The project only runs without any issues on PyCharm.</strike> 
    It can be run simply from a command prompt.
2. <strike>The first file, that you must run is createConfig.py to set up the paths.</strike>
    No need of running this file seperately.
3. <strike>This does not yet produce any recommendations, needs a lot of fixing.</strike>
    It does generate recommendations based on the genre(s) for which the user has seen the **maximum** number of movies, and the
    recommendations are movies from that genre(s) which the user has **not** seen.

## How to generate recommendations?

Generating recommendations is as simple as running the generateRecommendations.py file, and providing it a user id as input. 
<code>python generateRecommendations.py</code>
